# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is a final project for Getting and Cleaning Data Course. The objective of the project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. <br/>

#### Contents of the repository:
The submission consists of the following files:<br/>
*run_analysis.R* - R script that processes the data.<br/>
*CodeBook.md* - Codebook explaining the variables and analysis performed on the data set.<br/>
<br/>

#### Generated output:
*clean_data.txt* - final data set with mean and standard deviation for each measurement created by merging and transforming source data collected from the accelerometers.<br/>
*summary_data.txt* - summarized data set base on *clean_data.txt* with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. <br/>
<br/>

#### Source data:
The data set is data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The source data set is "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
